Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                        Lynch and Boudin,*\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Johnny Rivera-González on brief for appellant.\n     W. Stephen Muldrow, United States Attorney, Mariana E. Bauzá-\nAlmonte, Assistant United States Attorney, Chief, Appellate\nDivision, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                        October 30, 2020\n\n\n\n\n* While this case was submitted to a panel that included Judge\nTorruella, he did not participate in the issuance of the panel's\nopinion. The remaining two panelists therefore issued the opinion\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 46(d).\n\f             BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.       Edwin Jurado-Nazario pled guilty\n\nto two counts of Production of Child Pornography, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n2551(a) and (e), and two counts of Transportation of a Minor with\n\nthe Intent to Engage in Criminal Sexual Activity, see 18 U.S.C. §\n\n2423(a).     For   these   offenses,    his   plea   agreement      tentatively\n\ncalculated a prison term of 210 to 262 months.\n\n             The starting point for a district court's sentencing\n\ndetermination      \"is     the    guideline   range,    not    the     parties'\n\nrecommendations.\"        United States v. Cortés-Medina, 819 F.3d 566,\n\n573 (1st Cir. 2016).             Here, the district court made its own\n\ncalculations, resulting in a proposed sentence between 324 and 405\n\nmonths. The court then granted Jurado-Nazario a downward variance,\n\nciting his service in the United States Army, and sentenced him to\n\na prison term of 300 months.\n\n             Jurado-Nazario appealed, arguing that his sentence was\n\nsubstantively unreasonable and that the government violated his\n\nplea agreement by defending the sentence.\n\n             Before this court, Jurado-Nazario conceded that the\n\ndistrict court correctly calculated the applicable guidelines\n\nrange and that his sentence was procedurally sound, but he argued\n\nthat the district court abused its discretion, thus creating a\n\nsentence that was substantively unreasonable, by impermissibly\n\nbalancing the sentencing \"pros and cons.\"            The government answered\n\nthat   the    sentence,     twenty-four    months    below    the    applicable\n\n\n                                     - 2 -\n\fguidelines range, was substantively reasonable.      Jurado-Nazario\n\nresponded that the government violated his plea agreement, in which\n\nthey agreed not to recommend a sentence higher than 235 months, by\n\ndefending the reasonableness of his 300-month sentence.\n\n          Breach of Plea Agreement.    Although \"arguments raised\n\nfor the first time in an appellate reply brief [are] ordinarily\n\ndeemed waived,\" United States v. Casey, 825 F.3d 1, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n2016), an appellant's reply to an argument raised for the first\n\ntime in the opposing appellee's brief has not been waived, for the\n\nappellant brought the issue to the court's attention \"at the\n\nearliest point when it was logical to do so.\"    Holmes v. Spencer,\n\n685 F.3d 51, 66 (1st Cir. 2012); see also Rivera-Carrasquillo v.\n\nCentro Ecuestre Madrigal, Inc., 812 F.3d 213, 228 n.29 (1st Cir.\n\n2016); Alfano v. United States, 592 F. Supp. 2d 149, 153 (D. Me.\n\n2008) (describing a case in which this court reviewed on the merits\n\nan argument raised for the first time in the defendant's reply\n\nbrief because the argument was in response to a contention raised\n\nfor the first time in the government's brief).\n\n          Because Jurado-Nazario raised the argument that the\n\ngovernment violated the terms of his plea agreement \"at the\n\nearliest point when it was logical to do so,\" this court will not\n\n\"fault him for not having raised it sooner.\"    Holmes, 685 F.3d at\n\n66; see also Sparkle Hill, Inc. v. Interstate Mat Corp., 788 F.3d\n\n25, 29-30 (1st Cir. 2015).   \"Whether the government has breached\n\n\n                              - 3 -\n\fits plea agreement . . . presents a question of law, and our review\n\nis de novo.\"      United States v. Cruz-Vázquez, 841 F.3d 546, 548\n\n(1st Cir. 2016) (citing United States v. Rivera-Rodríguez, 489\n\nF.3d 48, 57 (1st Cir. 2007)).\n\n           A plea agreement is interpreted according to normal\n\ncontract principles.      See United States v. Marín-Echeverri, 846\n\nF.3d 473, 477-78 (1st Cir. 2017).        This court has been \"scrupulous\n\nin holding defendants to the terms of the plea agreements that\n\nthey enter knowingly and voluntarily.\"           United States v. Ortiz-\n\nSantiago, 211 F.3d 146, 151 (1st Cir. 2000).            But \"[w]hen a plea\n\nrests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the\n\nprosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or\n\nconsideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\"           Cruz-Vázquez, 841\n\nF.3d at 548 (quoting Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262\n\n(1971)).\n\n           Jurado-Nazario's       plea   agreement     calculated    a    total\n\noffense level of 37, for which the guidelines recommend a prison\n\nterm of 210 to 262 months.         In Jurado-Nazario's plea agreement,\n\nthe government allowed \"the defendant to argue for a variant\n\nsentence of incarceration as low as 15 years (180 months)\" and\n\n\"reserve[d] the right to argue for a sentence of incarceration up\n\nto 235 months (19.5 years).\"        App. vol. I, 22.       Both sides then\n\npromised   that   \"no   further    adjustments    or    departures       to   the\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 4 -\n\fdefendant's total offense level shall be sought by the parties.\"\n\nApp. vol. I, 23.\n\n           The government kept its promise.              At the sentencing\n\nhearing, the government resisted Jurado-Nazario's request for a\n\n180-month prison term, emphasizing that Jurado-Nazario's crimes\n\ninvolved four different victims and equating the good qualities\n\nthat   Jurado-Nazario      had   put    forward   as   potential   mitigating\n\nfactors to those that a pedophile needs to gain a victim's trust.\n\nOn that basis, the Government suggested a prison term of 235\n\nmonths, exactly the term promised in Jurado-Nazario's plea.\n\n           The government did not breach the plea agreement by\n\narguing   before    this   court   that    Jurado-Nazario's    sentence   was\n\nreasonable.   Defending the district court's discretionary judgment\n\nto impose a 300-month sentence does not violate the government's\n\npromise to refrain from seeking \"adjustments or departures to the\n\ndefendant's total offense level\" or from recommending a sentence\n\nof over 235 months.        Those promises applied to the government's\n\nrecommendation at sentencing, not to a future appeal. Furthermore,\n\n                   [a]s an appellee, the government is\n                   tasked, in effect, with defending\n                   the district court's judgment when\n                   a criminal defendant appeals.    In\n                   our view, the government normally\n                   should be free, on appeal, to\n                   support a ruling of the district\n                   court even though a plea agreement\n                   precluded it below from arguing the\n                   position that underpins the ruling.\n\n\n\n                                       - 5 -\n\fUnited States v. Carbajal-Váldez, 874 F.3d 778, 786-87 (1st Cir.\n\n2017) (footnote omitted).\n\n             Substantive      Reasonableness.              Jurado-Nazario       was\n\nsentenced to a 300-month sentence, rather than a 180-month sentence\n\nas requested in his sentencing memorandum.                 An objection to his\n\nsentence on the ground of substantive reasonableness is therefore\n\npreserved.     See Holguin-Hernandez v. United States, 140 S. Ct.\n\n762, 766 (2020). Jurado-Nazario contends that the district court\n\nabused   its    discretion     when     it     impermissibly       balanced     the\n\nsentencing     factors   in   18   U.S.C.      §    3553(a),     resulting    in   a\n\nsubstantively unreasonable sentence.               We review his challenge for\n\nabuse of discretion, taking into account the totality of the\n\ncircumstances.    See Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007).\n\n             The district court adopted the pre-sentence report's\n\noffense level of 41 and a criminal history category of I, which\n\nindicated a sentencing range of 324 to 405 months in prison. Then,\n\nnoting   Jurado-Nazario's      military       service,     the    district    court\n\nsentenced him to 300 months.       Jurado-Nazario does not dispute that\n\nthe court adopted the correct guidelines range.                  Instead, he puts\n\nforward mitigating factors that, he alleges, support an even\n\ngreater downward variance than the one the court awarded.\n\n             Jurado-Nazario     claims       that    the   court    should     have\n\nfashioned a more lenient sentence because (1) he is a veteran who\n\nserved abroad in the US Army, (2) his family was abusive and\n\n\n                                      - 6 -\n\fneglectful to him as a child, (3) during his military service, he\n\nsuffered   a   traumatic      brain    injury   and    post-traumatic     stress\n\ndisorder   that     triggered    his    resulting      crimes,   and    (4)   the\n\nsentencing guidelines for child pornography are unduly harsh.                 But\n\nthe district court did not err.            First, the district court took\n\nhis military service into account and granted a more lenient\n\nsentence on that basis.         Second, Jurado-Nazario admits that his\n\nbackground was \"vastly discussed\" in court; \"[t]hat the sentencing\n\ncourt chose not to attach to certain of the mitigating factors the\n\nsignificance that the appellant thinks they deserved does not make\n\nthe sentence unreasonable.\"           United States v. Clogston, 662 F.3d\n\n588, 593 (1st Cir. 2011).        Third, the district court conducted an\n\nevidentiary hearing and then made a factual finding that there was\n\n\"no medical evidence\" of a traumatic brain injury and no evidence\n\nthat proved a causal connection between PTSD and Jurado-Nazario's\n\ncriminal behavior. In the context of sentencing, we review factual\n\nfindings for clear error, see United States v. Carpenter, 781 F.3d\n\n599, 622 (1st Cir. 2015), and here, the district court's findings\n\nwere not clearly erroneous.\n\n           Lastly,     some     do    regard    the    guidelines   for   child\n\npornography    as     remarkably       harsh     considering     that     murder\n\nconvictions can yield shorter sentences.              See, e.g., Clogston, 662\n\nF.3d at 593 (calling the guidelines for child pornography cases\n\n\"very stern\").       Ultimately, however, the sentencing guidelines\n\n\n                                       - 7 -\n\freflect social attitudes and can be changed by the political\n\nbranches.    Here, the district court chose a 300-month sentence,\n\ntaking into account both Jurado-Nazario's specific circumstances\n\nand the fact that child pornography can expose victims to long-\n\nterm damage and must be deterred.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 8 -\n\f",

In Jurado-Nazario's plea agreement,\n\nthe government allowed \"the defendant to argue for a variant\n\nsentence of incarceration as low as 15 years (180 months)\" and\n\n\"reserve[d] the right to argue for a sentence of incarceration up\n\nto 235 months (19.5 years).\"        App. vol. I, 22.       Both sides then\n\npromised   that   \"no   further    adjustments    or    departures       to   the\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 4 -\n\fdefendant's total offense level shall be sought by the parties.\"\n\nApp. vol. I, 23.\n\n           The government kept its promise.              At the sentencing\n\nhearing, the government resisted Jurado-Nazario's request for a\n\n180-month prison term, emphasizing that Jurado-Nazario's crimes\n\ninvolved four different victims and equating the good qualities\n\nthat   Jurado-Nazario      had   put    forward   as   potential   mitigating\n\nfactors to those that a pedophile needs to gain a victim's trust.\n\nOn that basis, the Government suggested a prison term of 235\n\nmonths, exactly the term promised in Jurado-Nazario's plea.\n\n           The government did not breach the plea agreement by\n\narguing   before    this   court   that    Jurado-Nazario's    sentence   was\n\nreasonable.   Defending the district court's discretionary judgment\n\nto impose a 300-month sentence does not violate the government's\n\npromise to refrain from seeking \"adjustments or departures to the\n\ndefendant's total offense level\" or from recommending a sentence\n\nof over 235 months.        Those promises applied to the government's\n\nrecommendation at sentencing, not to a future appeal. Furthermore,\n\n                   [a]s an appellee, the government is\n                   tasked, in effect, with defending\n                   the district court's judgment when\n                   a criminal defendant appeals.    In\n                   our view, the government normally\n                   should be free, on appeal, to\n                   support a ruling of the district\n                   court even though a plea agreement\n                   precluded it below from arguing the\n                   position that underpins the ruling.\n\n\n\n                                       - 5 -\n\fUnited States v.

Jurado-Nazario       was\n\nsentenced to a 300-month sentence, rather than a 180-month sentence\n\nas requested in his sentencing memorandum.                 An objection to his\n\nsentence on the ground of substantive reasonableness is therefore\n\npreserved.     See Holguin-Hernandez v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">762</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 766 (2020). Jurado-Nazario contends that the district court\n\nabused   its    discretion     when     it     impermissibly       balanced     the\n\nsentencing     factors   in   18   U.S.C.      §    3553(a),     resulting    in   a\n\nsubstantively unreasonable sentence.               We review his challenge for\n\nabuse of discretion, taking into account the totality of the\n\ncircumstances.    See Gall v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51 (2007).\n\n             The district court adopted the pre-sentence report's\n\noffense level of 41 and a criminal history category of I, which\n\nindicated a sentencing range of 324 to 405 months in prison. Then,\n\nnoting   Jurado-Nazario's      military       service,     the    district    court\n\nsentenced him to 300 months.       Jurado-Nazario does not dispute that\n\nthe court adopted the correct guidelines range.                  Instead, he puts\n\nforward mitigating factors that, he alleges, support an even\n\ngreater downward variance than the one the court awarded.\n\n             Jurado-Nazario     claims       that    the   court    should     have\n\nfashioned a more lenient sentence because (1) he is a veteran who\n\nserved abroad in the US Army, (2) his family was abusive and\n\n\n                                      - 6 -\n\fneglectful to him as a child, (3) during his military service, he\n\nsuffered   a   traumatic      brain    injury   and    post-traumatic     stress\n\ndisorder   that     triggered    his    resulting      crimes,   and    (4)   the\n\nsentencing guidelines for child pornography are unduly harsh.                 But\n\nthe district court did not err.            First, the district court took\n\nhis military service into account and granted a more lenient\n\nsentence on that basis.         Second, Jurado-Nazario admits that his\n\nbackground was \"vastly discussed\" in court; \"[t]hat the sentencing\n\ncourt chose not to attach to certain of the mitigating factors the\n\nsignificance that the appellant thinks they deserved does not make\n\nthe sentence unreasonable.\"           United States v. Clogston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"618655\"><a href=\"/opinion/618655/united-states-v-clogston/\"><span class=\"volume\">662</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593 (1st Cir. 2011).        Third, the district court conducted an\n\nevidentiary hearing and then made a factual finding that there was\n\n\"no medical evidence\" of a traumatic brain injury and no evidence\n\nthat proved a causal connection between PTSD and Jurado-Nazario's\n\ncriminal behavior. In the context of sentencing, we review factual\n\nfindings for clear error, see United States v. Carpenter, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">781</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">599</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 622 (1st Cir. 2015), and here, the district court's findings\n\nwere not clearly erroneous.\n\n           Lastly,     some     do    regard    the    guidelines   for   child\n\npornography    as     remarkably       harsh     considering     that     murder\n\nconvictions can yield shorter sentences.              See, e.g., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"618655\"><span class=\"antecedent_guess\">Clogston,</span> <a href=\"/opinion/618655/united-states-v-clogston/\"><span class=\"volume\">662</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> at <span class=\"page\">593</span> </a></span><pre class=\"inline\">(calling the guidelines for child pornography cases\n\n\"very stern\").       Ultimately, however, the sentencing guidelines\n\n\n                                       - 7 -\n\freflect social attitudes and can be changed by the political\n\nbranches.    Here, the district court chose a 300-month sentence,\n\ntaking into account both Jurado-Nazario's specific circumstances\n\nand the fact that child pornography can expose victims to long-\n\nterm damage and must be deterred.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               - 8 -\n\f</pre>",
